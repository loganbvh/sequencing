``sequencing`` is a Python package for simulating realistic quantum control sequences using [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/index.html). Built for researchers and quantum engineers, ``sequencing`` provides an intuitive framework for constructing models of quantum systems
composed of many modes and generating complex time-dependent control Hamiltonians
for [master equation simulations](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html).
