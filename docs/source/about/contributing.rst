Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

Code of Conduct
===============

Everyone interacting in the ``sequencing`` project's code base,
issue tracker, and any communication channels is expected to follow the
`PyPA Code of Conduct <https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/>`_.


Reporting Bugs
==============

Report bugs `by creating an issue <https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue>`_.

When reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.


Submitting Feedback
===================

The best way to send feedback is to `create an issue <https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue>`_.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work and why it is important.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome.


Pull Request Guidelines
=======================

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the ``sequencing`` codebase, and we actively welcome them.
All pull requests should abide by the following guidelines:

1. All code must be compatible with `Black code style <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ (a subset of `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_). We recommend using `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ locally to ensure compatibility.

2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.

3. If you've changed APIs (e.g. function signatures), update the documentation accordingly. If your pull request adds new features, please consider creating an example Jupyter notebook demonstrating the features.

4. Ensure that all tests pass locally before creating the PR.


Getting Started
===============

Ready to contribute? Follow `GitHub best practices <https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/>`_ - in short:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Fork the repo on GitHub to your personal account.
3. Add your fork as a remote.
4. Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch.
5. Create a topic branch, e.g. `feature/short-description` for a feature or enhancement.
6. Make your changes and commit them (testing locally).
7. Push changes to the topic branch on *your* remote once local tests pass and you are happy with the changes you've made.
8. Create a pull request against the base ``main`` branch through the Github website.
